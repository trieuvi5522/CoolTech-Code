# CoolTech Danmark A/S — IoT Code Repository

This repository contains code and reusable assets I created while working at **CoolTech Danmark A/S**.  
The content is organized by application area to make it easy to navigate, reuse, and maintain.

## Structure

The work is grouped into three main categories:

### 1) Node-RED
Automation logic, integrations, and UI/dashboard components built in Node-RED.
- Flows and subflows
- Examples and documentation for deployment and usage

### 2) [Datacake IoT Platfrom](https://datacake.co/)
Code related to Datacake platform configuration and data handling.
- Decoders (e.g., LoRaWAN/HTTP payload decoding)
- Downlink/control payloads
- GraphQL queries/mutations
- Examples and references

### 3) [Shelly Devices](https://www.shelly.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooy_5wa9kGA4rCoo5eTg8cRWT4mIu9Dca_M5jWQUoPJXRqrnwfT)
Scripts and templates for Shelly devices used in edge control and monitoring.
- Device scripts (Gen2/Gen3, Pro series, etc.)
- Configuration templates and mappings
- MQTT topic conventions and control patterns
- Example implementations per project/site

## Notes
- Each section includes documentation and examples where applicable.
- Naming conventions and folder structure are designed to support multiple projects/sites and long-term maintenance.
